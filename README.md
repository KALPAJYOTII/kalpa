This project appears to be a basic 

"New Calendar" application developed in C programming language. While the full functionality isn't evident from the provided raw data, 

the presence of C source code (calender.c) and an executable file (calender.exe) indicates a compiled program designed to perform calendar-related operations. 

The .rar archive suggests it's a packaged project, likely including all necessary files for compilation and execution.
